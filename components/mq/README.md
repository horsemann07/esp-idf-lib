# MQ SENSORS LIBRARY

## Description:

MQ gas sensors are a family of sensors which are used to detect a wide variety of gases
like alcohol, smoke, methane, LPG, hydrogen, NH3, Benzene, Propane etc. These sensors
are made up of electrode which is coated with a sensing material, and it is heated to
make it more reactive and sensitive. When the gas reacts with these electrodes, its
resistance changes, more the gas, less is the resistance and vice-versa.

**Here are some MQ series of gas sensors**

| MQ Sensor | Gas detected                                                            |

| MQ214     | Methane, Natural gas                                                    |

**What is 1 ppm equal to?**

When measuring gases like carbon dioxide, oxygen, or methane, the term concentration is used to describe the amount of gas by volume in the air. The 2 most common units of measurement are parts-per-million, and percent concentration.

Parts-per-million (abbreviated ppm) is the ratio of one gas to another. For example, 1,000ppm of CO means that if you could count a million gas molecules, 1,000 of them would be of carbon monoxide and 999,000 molecules would be some other gases.
